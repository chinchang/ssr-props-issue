# serversideprops issue

This repo is a minimal testcase of a issue related to serversiderprops in nextjs.

## Context

There are 2 monorepos in this repo - nextjs/ and blog/. Their deployment is configured using `now.json` - which is the old way of confguring vercel project. Internally now.json uses the `routes` key to configure the redirections.

## Issue

This is regarding the point here -> https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props#when-does-getserversideprops-run

> When you request this page on client-side page transitions through next/link or next/router, Next.js sends an API request to the server, which runs getServerSideProps
> getServerSideProps returns JSON which will be used to render the page. All this work will be handled automatically by Next.js, so you donâ€™t need to do anything extra as long as you have getServerSideProps defined.

On this website, when you click on "Goto a level page" link, the JSON request that goes is resulting in 404. And therefore, the whole page is fetched and complete reload happens.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Goto homepage
2. Open devtools
3. Click on "Goto a level page"
4. Instead of client side redirection, complete page reloads
5. Check in devtools, the JSON request for serverside props is 404
